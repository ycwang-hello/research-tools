Here I collect my personal reviews, tips and experience of some research tools, including but not limited to softwares. 

This is not meant to be an objective review: the content is highly subjective and is for your information only. 

List of my notes:
- [Obsidian](obsidian.md), a note-taking software ([official site](https://obsidian.md/)).
