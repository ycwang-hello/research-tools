# research-tools
Here I collect my personal reviews, tips and experience of some research tools, including but not limited to softwares. 

This is not meant to be an objective review: the content is highly subjective and is for your information only. 

List of my notes:
- [Obsidian](obsidian.md), a note-taking software ([official site](https://obsidian.md/)).

Other resources:
- LaTeX:
  - My LaTeX templates.
  - My Python script `latexport.py`, which helps you prepare a minimum working set of LaTeX files (everything into a zip file without subdirectories). See [LaTeX/README.md](LaTeX/README.md) for more information.
